This is a simple static website built as a practice project to strengthen my **HTML skills**.  
The website consists of a main `index.html` page that links to a few recipes.  

> ⚠️ The focus of this project is **HTML structure and practice** — not design.  
It may not look very pretty yet, but it’s all about building strong foundations.
